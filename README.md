# NYC-Taxi-data-analysis

This project is as a part of Maven Taxi Challenge

Dataset source: https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground


The Objective:

Welcome to the team!
We’ve been collecting trip data for ~4 years now, but without a proper analyst we haven’t been able to put it to good use. That's where you come in!
The raw data has some issues, so we'll need to make the adjustments and assumptions to clean and prep the data. 
Once the data is cleaned up, I’m hoping you can build me a dashboard to help with weekly planning and logistics.

### Data is cleaned with python as shared in the ipynb file
### Once cleaned, the dataset is exported into csv files and further analysis and visualizations are done in Tableau
